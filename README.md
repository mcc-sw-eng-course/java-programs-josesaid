![Hi Welcome!](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFuzyxDcgtVDA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1555545600&v=beta&t=je_7Hee8iktvST7FB1vTbM2yw_manVPspO2Vv1vlFrQ)


Hi! This is a **Java Project** created on **IntelliJ**. Please feel free to download the code and play with it.

# Tic Tac Toe - Console Version is appended on the ProgrammingExercise31.java file
# Tic Tac Toe - GUI is pending to be uploaded into this git repo. It is almost done, but by some time reasons was not uploaded in order to do not cause a mess on this GIT REPO. Currently is located on another git repo.
# File Structure

 1. The project has two main packages:
	 - src [files with the source code]
	 - test [unit tests]

## HTML Report with Code Coverage

The project on its content has a ***Test Results - All_in_java-programs-josesaid.html*** file with all the code coverage reports.

All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.


> **Note:** I strong suggest you to make use a Java IDE in order to configure/get every one of the depencies used on the project:

 1. JUnit
 2. Apache Commons IO
